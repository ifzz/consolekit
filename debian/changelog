  * debian/patches/11-unref-dbus-proxy.patch
    - Unref the dbus proxy when finalizing the session object, so that
      they are not leaked. (Closes: #521651)

consolekit (0.2.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/04-defer_daemonizing.patch
    - Daemonize after registering the dbus name to avoid a race condition
      where dbus-daemon thinks that console-kit-daemon has failed to start
      properly and returns an error to the caller. (Closes: #507815)
  * Document all patches to make lintian happy.

consolekit (0.2.10-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/patches/03-cleanup_console_tags.patch
    - Properly initialize GError to avoid daemon crash if /var/run/console/
      does not exist. Also, demote message about it from warning to debug,
      since it is not an error condition at all. (Closes: #492686)
      Patch by Martin Pitt, thanks.
