      ConsoleKit2 is a framework for keeping track of the various
      users, sessions, and seats present on a system.  It
      provides a mechanism for software to react to changes of any of
      these items or of any of the metadata associated with them.
      ConsoleKit2 also allows fast switching between open sessions on
      the computer.

      William Jon McCann was the primary maintainer of ConsoleKit and
      most of this documentation was written by him for ConsoleKit. It
      has been adapted for ConsoleKit2.

    <title>Defining the Problem</title>
    <para>
    A simple example is two users logging into a computer at the same time.
    They may be sharing the same set of hardware for their graphical session,
    such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. ConsoleKit2 will keep track of
    those resouces and which session is active and should have use of that
    hardware at a given time.
