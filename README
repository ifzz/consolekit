What is ConsoleKit2?
===================

ConsoleKit2 is a framework for defining and tracking users, login
sessions, and seats.

What is a seat?
===============

A seat is a collection of sessions and a set of hardware (usually at
least a keyboard and mouse).  Only one session may be active on a
seat at a time.

What is a session?
==================

A session is a collection of all processes that originate from a single
common ancestor and retain knowledge of a secret.  As an implementation
detail, this secret may be stored in the process environment by the
login manager under the name XDG_SESSION_COOKIE.
